  Chap. 1	TF Common Problems (and Some Solutions)
  
  Introduction: Hell everyone. Here is a working database of the types of problems instructors commonly experience. I would like for you familiarize yourself with these Questions and Answers (solutions) as well as contribute to the list. If you find yourself in a bind, do not hesitate to escalate an issue in SLACK to the TF Managers (@Ben Pincus, @Alec Hills, or @Dylan Smith who will then escalate to Eli as final authority). Thank you
  
  
  Q1.	Stduent doesn’t have UCOMMONS set up yet. Can he/she join the lecture?
  A1: Student should first contact their Program Coordinator. They MUST have UCommons credentials to join a class. This is covered in the student orientation.
  A2: If instructor wants to allow students to audit the class, instructors need to clear this with Course Support/Vicky prior to class. TFs cannot give this permission
  Note: giving student direct link will cause security issues and instructors should not share the zoom link with students. Once know a link is shared, report to @Eli to change zoom settings.
  Q2.	Students can't find documents
  A1: Students can access all course materials from the following steps: Step 1	They are logged into UCommons
  Step 2	They click the title of the lesson (as shown below)
  
  Step 3	The link will take students into the Modules page in Canvas
   
   
  (https://ucommons.instructure.com/). Ask them to click on “Directions” and look
  for the materials there.
  Materials may linked from this page.
  
  Step 4	Other materials may be found in folders. In the same Canvas view, click on “Files,”
  then open the folder for this lesson and then the “live lecture resources” folder.
  
  Step 5	Course level materials that are related to multiple lessons can be found in some
  
   
  courses (faculty option) by clicking on “Modules” and scrolling to the top of the
  page.
  
  
  
  A2: Alternatively, students should be able to quickly find lecture slides and handouts after clicking the “join lecture” button on UCOMMONS. Slides can be found on the Slides tab if the faculty has loaded them in the “slides” folder in Canvas files. Handouts are linked under “Class Resources” if they are in the “live lecture resources” folder in Canvas, and published.
  
  A3: If all students cannot locate materials, escalate to TF Managers (Ben, Alec, Dylan) – the
  reason is that it’s not published or not in Canvas at all.
  
  Q3.	Students not showing up in HomeStudio
  A1: Check the participant list on zoom to make sure there are students in the meeting. A2: Students may be in wrong lecture
  A3: Students/Instructors may need to refresh [exit and re-join the lecture]
  A4: Students did not join zoom through UCOMMONS or joined zoom with different account. Ask to refresh page, then ask them to leave Zoom, click “Join Lecture”à “join Zoom” button. A5: If instructors cannot see all students in HomeStudio, it might because the HomeStudio is launched to the wrong course (in situations where the instructor is teaching two different courses). The TF who launched the HomeStudio will need to end the first session and then launch the second session. Please note, the start and end times for each lesson is in director.
  Remember to come back and end a session. At the end of the class session (or your shift) remember to end all non-running live lectures.
   
   
  A6: If instructors cannot see all students in HomeStudio, it might because the instructor turned on the home studio computer too late (meaning we couldn’t launch through remote control).
  Recommend the instructors to have their studios on 60 minutes at least, prior to class. Escalate this to TF managers to relaunch the HomeStudio for the instructor.
   
  Q4.	Students cannot hear the video
  A1: The instructor needs to share screen and check the box “share computer sound”
  
  Q5.	Students cannot view the slide that is shared by professor
  A1: Double check with the instructor that he/she has shared screen with the students. Remind the instructor to move the documents/slide to the shared screen.
  Q6.	Students or Professors cannot login UCOMMONS
  A1: Navigate to the Ucommons login page and click the “Contact Technical Support” just
  beneath the login button;
  A form should appear for you entitled “Contact Support” in which you must fill in your name, email, location, help request type, and then a small detailed write-up of the issue, as well as any screenshot’s that might help identify the issue.
  Once that information is all set scroll to the bottom and submit.
   
      
  Q7.	Students’ video don’t automatically enlarge when he/she speaks
  A1: Instructor needs to click 'Automatic' while in Lecture Mode
  
  Q8.	Instructor asks, “How do I find roster?”
  A1: Step 1: Go to Dashboard in UCommons (join UCommons or leave Live Lecture to see dashboard) Select “Course Roster” on the Course Card.
   
   
  Step 2: Select Course Roaster
  
  Q9.	Instructor not seeing hand-raises
  A1: Students or instructor may be in wrong lecture
  A2: Students or instructor may need to refresh UCOMMONS A3: Student is raised hand through Zoom not UCOMMONS
  
  Q10.	Poll/Short Answer questions can’t “run”
  A1: Something not ended, ask the instructor to go to “all” and look for the red square.
   
  End running question
  Should be able run new poll/short answers now
  
  A2: If the current session doesn’t have a question running, it is likely that something not ended in previous sessions. The instructor should go to “ucommons”	“last lecture review” (if it was earlier lecture, click “prev lesson”)	and end the open question
   
     
  
  Q11.	ADD Poll/Short Answer questions during live lecture
  A1:
  Step 1	Direct the instructor to leave lecture
  
  Step 2	Select “Preview Lecture Content”
   
  
   
  Step 3	Create new or edit Poll or Short Answers
  
  Step 4	Return to “Dashboard”
  
  Step 5	Re-join Live Lecture
   
  Q12.	EDIT Poll/Short answer
  A1: To EDIT a poll or short answer during live lecture Step 1: Go to Poll or Short Answer Tab
  Step 2: Click on the poll or short answer to be edited Step 2: Click the “Edit” button
  
  Q13.	Sharing Poll/short answer results with students
  A1: Move the entire Chrome browser to the “Share” screen, or choose the Chrome browser to
  “Share” with Zoom. Results do not go to student desktops.
  
  Q14.	White board: Don't have control of white board (cannot find toolbar or move pages)
  A1: Check if the instructor has logged in with own account not as a guest
  
  Q15.	White board: When instructor switch pages, students don’t follow.
  A1: Make sure this button in the upper right corner of the page is checked by the instructor. The icon should have a raised baton.
  
  Q16.	Claim Host/Breakout Room - instructors don’t have access to breakout rooms”
  A1: The instructor needs to “Claim Host”
  i.	Tell the instructor you will put the answer in Chat in Zoom
  ii.	Start a PRIVATE CHAT in Zoom, and remind them...
  iii.	To go to Participants and “Claim Host” using either the Host key 020202 (if they do not have a live home studio) or their 2 digit HomeStudio number + 1234 .
  NOTE: the Home studio number should be on a label affixed to the front of their Home Studio. If it is not, ask them to look at the back of the machine for a two digit number. The first home studios have it written by hand on a piece of masking tape.
  
  Q17.	Breakout rooms – in-class assignment
  A1: if the professor didn’t pre-assign breakout rooms, they can randomly assign during the class from zoom:
   
   
  Note that in a big class, it’s better to choose “automatically” to save time. For a small class, one can use “manually” and select the students to go into each breakout room. Note that there is no way to “save” room assignments from one Zoom session to the next.
  
  Q18.	Breakout rooms – Pre-assignment
  A1: Instructors who wish to pre-assign students to Zoom breakout rooms should make a list of the rooms, and create the rooms manually after Zoom starts (they must “claim host”) but before class starts. Then during the lesson they must take the time to move students into the rooms.
  Students cannot be pre-assigned to a room before they join Zoom. They must be logged into Zoom already before they can be assigned.
  
  Students who do not join from the Zoom downloadable desktop app, but come in through a browser or phone app will not be able to join Zoom. Ask the students to join via the Zoom app.
  
  Q19.	Breakout rooms – not urgent issue (e.g. professor say ok, I don’t have to use it for this lecture right now)
  A1: TF's provide resources and links (Zoom Basics 1-12 list (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en- us/articles/206476093-Getting-Started-with-Video-Breakout-Rooms))
  
  Q20.	When UCommons is maximized, there is no access to the help button or some other resources located at the periphery of the screen; sometimes it's also not possible to scroll to see the entire frame. Is this something that can be fixed?
  A1. Let the instructor know they can reduce the size of the Chrome window by holding down the Control button (or the Command button for Mac) and hitting the minus sign. Ctrl – will zoom out so you can see more of your screen.
  A2: They can also go to the Chrome menu and choose Zoom In or Zoom out.
  Q21. Instructor only wants to see gallery mode in HomeStudio.
  A1. They can enter into Manual mode and select the Rear Camera. This will create that setting for them. (See screenshot)
   
  
   
  
  
  Q22.	Instructor needs to change course material (For escalating to Course Support)
  A1: Please comment HANDOFF and tag @ Vicki Rath, @ Jonathan Davis, @ faith.li, @ Eli Course support email: course.support@idesignedu.org
  Q23.	Instructor wants last minute changes to PPT
  A1: For example, the instructor wants students to have the latest one. Ask them to contact course support after class. course.support@idesignedu.org
  
  A2: Say “unfortunately I cannot help with this immediately, you would need to email course.support@idesignedu.org to update the material. We would recommend you to share the updated PPT (on Zoom) during this class and tell students that the new slides will be uploaded after the class. [provide course.support@idesignedu.org to the instructor through private zoom chat]
  
  Q24.	Instructor wants to change wording of an assignment
  A1: Say, “Have you tried to edit it directly in Canvas? As an instructor you will have an “Edit” button on almost every page, with edit tools very similar to any word processing program. After you edit, you will need to save your changes.” If they cannot find it, or have any issue at all with this answer, go to A2.
  
  A2: Say “unfortunately I cannot help with this immediately. The course support team will be able to help after class. Please contact course.support@idesignedu.org [provide course.support@idesignedu.org to the instructor through private zoom chat]
  
  Q25.	Instructor asks, “How can I see if a student has completed post/pre work?”
  A1: Say “unfortunately I cannot help with this immediately. This is a course support issue
  course.support@idesignedu.org [provide course.support@idesignedu.org to the instructor 
   
  through private zoom chat]
  
  Q26.	Instructor can't find today's lecture – Course card is gone
  A1: Follow instructions for “Instructor can’t find today’s lecture – Blue join lecture button not active (Q19). Still no course card...
  
  A2: Escalate to TF Managers (Ben, Alec, Dylan)
  A3: Emergency, Escalate to Curriculum Design (@vickirath in SLACK) [will take about 5 minutes]
  
  Q27.	Instructor can't find today's lecture – Blue join button not active
  A1: Check class calendar (have instructor share screen, click Class Calendar as shown). After updating, ask instructor to refresh browser.
  Edit class to the correct date and time
   
  
  A2: If not working, escalate to TF Managers (@Ben/Alec/Dylan in Slack)
  
  Q28.	HomeStudio set-up or launching failure
  A1: HomeStudio might be launched to the wrong course (in situations where the instructor is teaching two different courses). The TF who launched the HomeStudio will need to end the first session and then launch the second session. Please note, the start and end times for each lesson is in director. Remember to come back and end a session. At the end of the class session (or your shift) remember to end all non-running live lectures.
   
  A2: The instructor might launched the home studio too late. Recommend the instructors to have their studios on 90 minutes at least, prior to class. Escalate this to TF managers to relaunch the HomeStudio for the instructor.
  A3: if TF has access to Director/LogMeIn, Log-out of Director. Refresh. Log-in Director & LogMeIn. Relaunch. If fails, escalate to TF Manager.
  Q29.	HomeStudio needs to be relaunched
  A1: TF can refresh through “Re-start Apps” button
  Q30.	HomeStudio is on sleep mode./ HomeStudio requires a password on Instructor’s
  computer
  A1 :
  ·	Use LogMeIn to go in and unlock it (or escalate to TF responsible for launching by tagging them);
  ·	Navigate to the Windows Settings page and click the “System” Option on the top left of the
  window.
  ·	Next Select the “Power & Sleep” Option from the list on the left side of the window.
  ·	Within the Power & Sleep window, there is a drop down menu for “Screen” and “Sleep”. Make sure “Never”	is selected for both. This will ensure the pc sleep function is deactivated.
   
  
     
  
  Q31. HomeStudio is making noise / Instructor hearing feedback
  A1: End the lecture in Director. Use LogMeIn to disable the audio settings in the HomeStudio. Re-launch in Director.
  A2: Escalate the problem to the TF that is responsible for the class.
  Q32. HomeStudio computer is turned on but TF can’t see it as active in Direct.
  A1: Ask instructor to run a speedtest Fast.com (often instructors have the studio on but not connected to internet)
  Q33. UCommons is slow loading
  A1: We will escalate this to the technical team. Please also to contact Help Desk on UCommons. There is a link on every page of UCommons, including the login page (see photo). Unfortunately this will be solved by the next day, please use zoom without UCOMMONS today.
   
   
  Q34.	Zoom issues i.e. cannot claim host
  A1: When problems arise and could not be fixed from our end, it might be caused by Zoom.
  Here are two links to check Zoom’s status:
  •	https://status.zoom.us
  •	https://downdetector.com/status/zoom/
  If so, explain to the professor that this is a zoom issue and should be resolved by Zoom soon.
  
  
  
  
  Chap. 2 Suggested Scripts for Teaching Facilitators
  After joining the Live Lecture Zoom session, wait for a pause in case the professor is talking to the students.
  
  Step 1	ASK: “Hello professor. I’m [first name] your Teaching Facilitator. How can I help?”
  
  Step 2	LISTEN:
  
  During the explanation of the issue, check for understanding of the basic issue. “To be sure I
  understand, you are unable to 	, is that right?”
  Ask the professor to share screen with you. “Could you please share your
  UCOMMONS/Whiteboard [wherever the problem is probably is] with me?”
  Ask follow-up questions that require statements of observable facts. Examples:
  •	“What do you see when you click that?” NOT “What happens if you click that?”
  •	“Did you click the ‘Join Zoom’ button?” NOT “How did you get into Zoom?”
  •	“What did the error message say?” NOT “What error message did you get?”
  •	“Do you see the blue ‘Live Lecture’ button now?” NOT “Are you on the home page?”
  •	“What Lesson Number is showing on your screen?” NOT “Which lesson are you joining?”
   
  Step 3	PLAN: State out loud exactly what you are going to do.
  
  •	“Okay, I’m going to…
  •	“…step away for just a moment to see if I can find a solution. Is that okay with you?”
  •	“…ask you to close and reopen Zoom, then click Join Zoom again.”
  •	If you are leaving to research or escalate, follow the [problem escalation procedure]
  
  Step 4	SOLVE
  
  When unable to resolve:
  •	Confirm that the issue cannot be resolved during the Live Lecture.
  •	“Unfortunately, this is not something we can resolve during class. I will escalate this and we will resolve this as soon as we can.”
  When able to resolve:
  •	Confirm that the issue is resolved. “Did that help?”
  •	Always close with:
  ·	“Is there anything else I can do?” If no: “Great, thank you.” If yes: “How can I help?”
  Complete your notes in slack: reply in the thread e.g. “Prof can't see students. Solved.”
  
  Chap. 3 Problem Escalation Procedure
  If you need to escalate:
  Step 1	Ask the instructor if you can take a moment to research the problem. “Would it be all right if
  I take a just a few moments to research this?”
  Step 2	Immediately click on the information icon at the top left corner of the zoom meeting window.
   
   
  Step 3	Click “Copy Link” to copy the Zoom url with password to your clipboard
  Stay in the Zoom meeting on Mute with camera off
  Step 5	Look through this and other documentation carefully, using keyword search. Step 6	If you cannot find a solution within one minute,
  a)	Tag a TF Manager in SLACK and add a note about the issue.
  b)	Paste the Zoom link you copied
  c)	Inform instructor that help will arrive shortly
  Stay in the Zoom meeting until help arrives and the resolution is complete.
  Step 8	After the issue is resolved and the manager leaves, thank the instructor for their patience and ask if there is anything else you can do.
   
  Chap. 4 Procedures to Set up HomeStudio
  
  HomeStudio is the screen where instructors are able to see students who have joined the live lecture. The students will always show up in the same spot. When instructors use lecture model on UCOMMONS, the screen they see will mimic HomeStudio. When they click on a student on through UCOMMONS, the student’s video will be full screen on the HomeStudio screen as well.
  
  4.1	Procedures:
  
  Step 1	Login LogMeIn and director.shorelight.com [see director passwords in 4.3] Step 2	Director will show which HomeStudios are to be used today.
  Step 3	Go to LogMeIn and find that HomeStudio. Enter computer access code and login. The screen will look like the following:
   
  Step 4	Remote control the HomeStudio by swiping up and typing in password.
  Step 5	Go to start	settings	system	sound	manage sound devices	Make sure that all of these are disabled. (e.g. speaker, microphone)
  Step 6	Go back to Director and start the HomeStudio 60 to 90 minutes before the lecture. (you can ignore the error for sound and microphone disabled)
   
  Step 7 Unless swamped by other calls, pop-back in on lessons to see if the students have populated the HomeStudio screen, thus confirming accurate launch.
  Step 8 When the class is about to finish, go to LogMeIn to check if the meeting is finished. If it has, end the HomeStudio on Director, click disconnect on LogMeIn and close the remote control window.
  
  
  4.2	Notes:
  
  1.	If the HomeStudio is turned off but the lecture is starting soon, find the course and contact information of the professor. Text message “Hi This is xxx from shorelight. We are going to launch your HomeStudio for your courses shortly. I can see that you system is not turned on. Could you please turn on your system and connect to the internet at least 30 mins before the class so that we can get in and make sure everything is ready. Thank you and have a nice day.”
  2.	If you found the professor is using HomeStudio computer when you are trying to launch,
  Type in “Hello professor, we are about get ready to launch your HomeStudio for your
  class.” See if they could close the windows and let you launch the HomeStudio.

  Chap. 5	Incident Close-out Procedures
  These are the procedures and options for closing out an incident in the
  
  
  5.1	Procedures:
  
  1.	Track issues as they develop using the “reply in thread” function of Slack.
  
  
  
  2.	If the incident is fully resolved, type in the word CLOSED in all caps at the end of the thread, followed by @[Ivanti TF]
  •	Example: CLOSED @johndoe
  •	Eli will designate the TF responsible for entering the information into the Ivanti incident tracking software
  •	The designated Ivanti TF will also need to add the Ivanti incident (reference number can be found in the initial automated request for help entry, see image below):
  1.	Basics of the issue
  2.	Resolution of the issue
  3.	TF name (TF who annotated)
  Example: HomeStudio not connected to web. CLOSED @dylan.smith
  
   
  3.	If the incident is not fully resolved, then before the TF (or TF Manager, if it has been escalated) moves on to any other incident, type the word OPEN in all caps at the end of the thread, followed by @[manager]
  •	If TF, show the manager |
  Example: HomeStudio not connected to web. OPEN @benpincus
  •	If TF Manager, show to Eli |
  Example: HomeStudio not connected to web. OPEN @benpincus @eli
  
  •	TF Managers will look for OPEN incidents during the day and, at the end of the day, take other actions as necessary to resolve the issue.
  
  
  
  4.	If the incident includes a component that needs resolution elsewhere, type the word HANDOFF in all caps at the end of the thread, followed by to whom it was sent:
  
  •	Example: Instructor cannot find handout. HANDOFF @victoria rath (on-live lecture Canvas/UCommons issue)
  
  •	Example: HomeStudio keeps crashing. HANDOFF @roman.burdakov (engineering, software issue)
  
  •	Example: HomeStudio won’t power on. HANDOFF @jeremy.busey
  (hardware issue)
